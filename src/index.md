  <h1>Beyond Notability Data Essays</h1>

  
</div>


---
These data essays were written in Autumn/Winter 2024 as an output of the [Beyond Notability](https://beyondnotability.org/) project, funded between 2021 and 2024 by the [Arts and Humanities Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/ahrc/), UK (Project Reference [AH/V01384X/1](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FV01384X%2F1)).

Taken together the data essays fulfil a key aim of the project: to experiment with interactive approaches to data recorded in [our wikibase](https://beyond-notability.wikibase.cloud/wiki/Main_Page), a collection of '[linked data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data)' about women's work in archaeology, history and heritage between 1870 and 1950. Emcompassing over 30,000 statements related to over 900 women, the wikibase forms major research output of the project.

Each data essay digs into a facet of the wikibase, moving between data, what that data represents (or, more correctly in most cases, is *trying* to represent), and how that data is presented in visual form. As historians who use computational methods, we were drawn both to topical questions - patterns relating to [education](https://beyond-notability.github.io/beyond-notability-observable-essays/education.html), how [motherhood](https://beyond-notability.github.io/beyond-notability-observable-essays/mothers.html) interacted with work - and questions about computational historical methods - the nature of [residence](https://beyond-notability.github.io/beyond-notability-observable-essays/residence.html) and [date](https://beyond-notability.github.io/beyond-notability-observable-essays/all-dates.html) data, the alure of [network](https://beyond-notability.github.io/beyond-notability-observable-essays/networks.html) visualisations. The results are necessarily exploratory, reflexive, and cautionary, and follow [D'Ignazio and Klein](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/czq9dfs5/release/3) in rejecting the seemingly inherent positivism of data visualisation. Instead, by producing visualisations that change as you hover over them, tweak a parameter, toggle an option, or even just expand and contract your browser, we urge the reader to use explorations of data at scale as always fluid, partial, and acts of making and remaking undertaken in the service of historical analysis. Yes, computational historians can and will put 'finished' graphs on a page. But before they do they will do a lot of what these data essays enable you to do: play.

All the dates
------------
 
- category filters



Childbirth
----------

- a bit more activity data? (RAI/SAL elections? spoke at?)
- Plot.axis not working (cf education) and Idk why

notes
- work includes `employed as` (only about 3 instances?) - maybe separate these out
- named children included (if they have a date of birth) as well as `had child in`

Education
--------

- more sharing code between the two tables 
- custom d3 shapes? (esp for start/end pairs)


Residence
--------

- some viz on people with only residence data for early or late in life; 
- examples of people with gaps: look at place data between those gaps, does it help explain absent residence data? 

notes
- make sure all this chimes with history of inward migration, socio-economic class dynamics [town/country, family homes], etc


Networks
-------

- will need d3 for any network graphs... could avoid having network graphs at all... :-0
- analysis of SAL elections started but work to do on change over time (excavation networks mostly done)

Summary of pages
------

1. All the dates data, with filters for categories
2. Childbirth and other activities before and after
3. Higher education and degrees timeline 
4. Something about residence and gaps in it [not started] {some viz on people with only residence data for early or late in life; then some examples of people with gaps: look at place data between those gaps, does it help explain absent residence data? --- make sure all this chimes with history of inward migration, socio-economic class dynamics [town/country, family homes], etc}
6. Networks around excavation; if there is enough data. [analysis WIP] 

Other pages retained (for now) for reference.
